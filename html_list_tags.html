    <dt>apple </dt>
        <dd>Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, 
            and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.
            It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, and sales of its computers, 
            including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, 
            Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line.
    <dt>banana </dt>
        <dd>A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large 
            herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.[3] In some countries, bananas used for cooking 
            may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, 
            color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered 
            with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. 
    <dt>cucumber </dt>
        <dd>Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely cultivated plant in the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae. 
            It is a creeping vine that bears cucumiform fruits that are used as vegetables. 
            There are three main varieties of cucumber: slicing, pickling, and seedless. Within these varieties, 
            several cultivars have been created. In North America, the term "wild cucumber" refers to plants 
            in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, but these are not closely related.
